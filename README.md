# MouseTrap - Android component

This project contains the code of the Android part of MouseTrap project. It has three main activities: login, trap selection (or multi trap view) and single trap view.

When the user enters in the application, he has to sign up or login. Once he signs in, he is presented with the multi trap view where he can add a trap, check the status and last photo of his traps or select a trap. After selecting a trap, the user is able to remove it or send commands to that trap: close/open the door, request a picture or change the timeout.
